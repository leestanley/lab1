                Ecommerce has revolutionizeed the way the world shops. Over 80% of the online population have shopped online. At the rate e-commerce is growing, it's estimated that it will make up about 95% of all purchases within the next 2 decades.
                Despite its success, however, e-commerce is still a very flawed industry. For one, it is completely dominated by big companies such as Amazon who controls 44% of the market. 46% of American small businesses do not even have a website, making it very difficult for them to enter e-commerce, much less compete with big companies. Additionally, delivery is extremely harmful to the environment due to excessive packaging and carbon emissions. E-commerce can also lead to higher prices because of shipping costs, making it difficult for people to partake in the online shopping experience.
                We wanted to help bridge that gap for small businesses to enter into e-commerce, but also retain their values of serving local communities, so we created Massit - an e-commerce platform that supports small businesses, reduces environmental impact, and saves customers money.
